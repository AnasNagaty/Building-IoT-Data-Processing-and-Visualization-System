# Building-IoT-Data-Processing-and-Visualization-System

Build an IoT data processing and visualization system that works alongside a smart building using Python. This system will track different sensors that are distributed throughout the building for example; temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and occupancy sensors. It aims at presenting building managers with real time information for quick decision making as well as analyses based on past events which will enable them reduce power consumption, enhance air cleanliness, and manage occupancy efficiently.
